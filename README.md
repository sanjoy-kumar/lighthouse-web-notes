## Syntax Highlighting & Code Blocks

### For highlight a string 

To help you figure out how to use single backtick enclosed the strings `hungry` and `availableTime` inside your function, try outputting their values to the Terminal as follows.

### For highlight a block of code

Three backticks use to designate a code block:

```javascript
function whatToDoForLunch(hungry, availableTime) {
  console.log("hungry is", hungry);
  console.log("availableTime is", availableTime);
}

```
